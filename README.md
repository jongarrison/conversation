Good Conversation

* Direct more than half of your talking into questions towards others
* Find commonality between yourself and others
* Be comfortable with gaps that let others add their thoughts
* The longer the pause, the larger the acceptable departure from previous topics
* Take responsibility for gently leading the conversation in directions that are satisfying to others. Great conversationalists will return the favor.
* Use Maszlow's hierarchy as a guide to conversation. If there is enough commonality uncovered, work your way up the hierarchy.
